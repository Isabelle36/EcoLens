# Developer week hackathon idea

# App Concept: EcoLens

## Core Purpose:
Empower users to make eco-friendly and health-conscious decisions by providing verified product information, environmental health alerts, and fraud prevention tools.

## Core Features:

### Environmental Health Insights:
- Real-time alerts on air quality, water safety, and climate conditions based on location.
- Personalized health tips linked to environmental factors (e.g., "High pollution detected—wear a mask to protect your lungs").
- Oracle's data can fuel this feature with reliable environmental stats.

### Eco-Product Verification:
- Users can scan or search for products to verify their eco-certifications and claims.
- Fingerprint tools ensure the authenticity of sustainability certifications, preventing greenwashing.
- Integrated Health Risks of Products:
- Highlight potential health risks associated with products (e.g., "This product contains harmful chemicals linked to respiratory issues").
- Provide alternative eco-friendly and health-safe options.
- Sustainability & Health Impact Score:
    -  Each product gets a combined score based on its health safety and eco-friendliness.
    - Include Oracle-backed data to assess the environmental impact of the product's production and disposal.

### Additional Features (Optional Enhancements):
- User-Reported Fraud Detection:
    - Enable users to report suspicious products or claims, which Fingerprint verifies.
    - Build a database of flagged products for wider community awareness.
- Personalized Recommendations:
    - Suggest healthier, eco-friendly alternatives based on user preferences.
    - For instance, recommend hypoallergenic, biodegradable products.
- Gamification:
    - Reward users with points for choosing eco-friendly or verified products, reducing their carbon footprint, or sharing the app with others.
- Educational Hub:
    - Articles and infographics explaining eco-certifications, health risks of certain chemicals, and sustainable living tips.
- Community Feedback:
    - Allow users to review products and share experiences to create a trustworthy platform.
- Personalized Experiences
    - Allow users to input their specific concerns (e.g., respiratory health, allergies, or skin sensitivity).
    - Tailor environmental alerts and product recommendations based on their preferences.
    - Example Problem Solved: A user with asthma gets tailored air quality warnings and mask suggestions.
- Impact Tracker
    - Let users track how their choices contribute to personal health improvements or environmental sustainability.
    - Example Problem Solved: Users see how switching to verified products reduced their carbon footprint or health risks.
- Accessibility Features
    - Provide audio alerts for environmental updates or fraud notifications for visually impaired users.
    - Example Problem Solved: Making the app usable for people with disabilities increases inclusivity.
- Real-Life Problem Solvers
    - Budget-Friendly Recommendations: Suggest eco-friendly products within the user’s budget.
    - Example Problem Solved: Overcomes the common perception that sustainable products are expensive.
- Product Alternatives: Show healthier or more sustainable product substitutes.
    - Example Problem Solved: Users easily switch to better options without research effort.

## Things We can do with python & Gemini

### Use Case: Verifying Eco-Certifications with AI-Powered Fraud Detection

### Workflow:

- User Action:
    - A user scans a product’s barcode or searches for it in the app.
- Backend Processing (Python):
    - The Python backend receives the product details (e.g., barcode or name).
    - Python uses requests or similar libraries to fetch data from an eco-certification database or API.
    - If no API exists, Python can scrape the certification website using Beautiful Soup or Scrapy.
- Fraud Detection (Gemini):
    - The Python backend sends the certification details to Gemini for analysis.
    - Gemini applies an AI model to check:
        - Whether the certification is authentic.
        - If the certification matches the product’s sustainability claims (e.g., recycled materials).
    - Gemini flags any anomalies, such as mismatched claims or unverifiable certifications.
- Feedback to User:
    - The Python backend processes Gemini’s response and sends a summary to the React frontend.
    - The user sees:
        - Certification status (authentic or not).
        - An eco-health impact score combining product sustainability and health risk.
        - Suggestions for verified eco-friendly alternatives (optional).

### Frontend Integration:
- Use Axios in React to send product data to the Python backend.
- Display the certification status and recommendations dynamically.

### How Gemini Adds Value:
- The fraud detection model from Gemini learns from large datasets of verified and fake certifications.
- Its AI ensures the system is robust against evolving fraud tactics.
- You can also use Gemini to predict future risks or generate insights for the user.

## MAIN FEATURES THAT WE HAVE TO IMPLEMENT FIRST

### Core Features to Implement First
To ensure a minimum viable product (MVP) that is functional and impactful, prioritize the following:

- Environmental Health Insights
    - Real-time location-based air quality, water safety, and climate alerts.
    - Show health tips tailored to environmental factors.
    - Why First: This feature directly impacts user health and demonstrates Oracle's integration early.
- Eco-Product Verification
    - Allow users to scan or search for products to verify certifications and claims.
    - Use Fingerprint's fraud detection to ensure certifications are legitimate.
    - Why First: It showcases how fraud detection technology (Fingerprint) is applied and solves a real-world problem.
- Combined Eco-Health Impact Score
    - Display a score that integrates eco-friendliness and health safety of products.
    - Leverage Oracle's data for environmental impact and user input for health aspects.
    - Why First: It ties both tracks into a unified and meaningful metric for the user.

### Tech Stack Suggestions

- Frontend:
    - Framework: React.js (user-friendly, efficient, and you're already experienced).
    - UI Framework: Tailwind CSS (lightweight, modern, and suitable for fast prototyping).
    - State Management: Redux or Context API for managing user preferences and alerts.
- Backend:
    - Framework: Node.js with Express (lightweight, scalable, and supports real-time data).
    - Database:

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
